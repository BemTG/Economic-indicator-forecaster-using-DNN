Forecasting Economic indicators using Neural Networks and Holt-Winter


Findings
- The model that performed the best was the linear neural network model as shown in the Forecasting CCI ML notebook. 
- The Holt winter model was good at predicting the cyclical patterns but was when forecasting out the reading were highly repetitive
- The LSTM model tests are inconclusive as it needs further research and more tinkering with the parameters.
